Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always
have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3
without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't cast them in this way
again until you finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell
slot."""
