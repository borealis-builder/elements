When you roll {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB}, you can regain all expended uses
of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can't do so again until
you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you
needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if
you have the {@condition Unconscious|XPHB} condition (not just the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition) or don Heavy armor."""
