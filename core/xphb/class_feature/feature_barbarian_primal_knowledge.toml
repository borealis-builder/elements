You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list
available to Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you
attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the
following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a
different ability: {@skill Acrobatics|XPHB}, {@skill Intimidation|XPHB}, {@skill
Perception|XPHB}, {@skill Stealth|XPHB}, or {@skill Survival|XPHB}. When you use
this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing
your agility, bearing, and senses."""
