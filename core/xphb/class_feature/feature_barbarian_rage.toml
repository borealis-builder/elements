description = """
You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you
extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB} if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in
the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use
when you finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB}, and you regain all expended
uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

### Damage Resistance

You have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing
damage.

### Rage Damage

When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an {@variantrule Unarmed
Strike|XPHB}—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage
that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage
column of the Barbarian Features table.

### Strength Advantage

You have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Strength checks and Strength saving
throws.

### No Concentration or Spells

You can't maintain {@status Concentration|XPHB}, and you can't cast spells.

### Duration

The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don
Heavy armor or have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition. If your Rage
is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by
doing one of the following:

- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You
can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes."""
