The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following
benefits.

### Evergreen Wild Shape

Whenever you roll {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} and have no uses of Wild Shape
left, you regain one expended use of it.

### Nature Magician

You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required).
Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a
single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if
you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you
use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Longevity

The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten
years that pass, your body ages only one year."""
