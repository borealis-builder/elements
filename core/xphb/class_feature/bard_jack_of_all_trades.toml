You can add half your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus} (round
down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and
that doesn't otherwise use your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}.

For example, if you make a Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check and lack {@skill
Athletics|XPHB} proficiency, you can add half your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus} to the check.

#### A Bard's Repertoire
>> Does your Bard beat a {@item drum|XPHB} while chanting the deeds of ancient
>> heroes? Strum a {@item lute|XPHB} while crooning romantic tunes? Perform arias
>> of stirring power? Recite dramatic monologues from classic tragedies? Use the
>> rhythm of a folk dance to coordinate the movement of allies in battle? Compose
>> naughty limericks?
>> 
>> When you play a Bard, consider the style of artistic performance you favor, the
>> moods you might invoke, and the themes that inspire your own creations. Are your
>> poems inspired by moments of natural beauty, or are they brooding reflections on
>> loss? Do you prefer lofty hymns or rowdy tavern songs? Are you drawn to laments
>> for the fallen or celebrations of joy? Do you dance merry jigs or perform
>> elaborate interpretive choreography? Do you focus on one style of performance or
>> strive to master them all?"""
