When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the
following conditions from the creature: {@condition Blinded|XPHB}, {@condition
Charmed|XPHB}, {@condition Deafened|XPHB}, {@condition Frightened|XPHB}, {@condition
Paralyzed|XPHB}, or {@condition Stunned|XPHB}. You must expend 5 {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB} from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions
you remove; those points don't also restore {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} to
the creature."""
