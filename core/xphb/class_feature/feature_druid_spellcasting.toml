description = """
You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature.
See {@book chapter 7|XPHB|7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information
below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the {@filter Druid spell
list|spells|class=Druid} later in the class's description.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the {@filter Druid spell
list|spells|class=Druid}. {@spell Druidcraft|XPHB} and {@spell Produce
Flame|XPHB} are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with
another cantrip of your choice from the {@filter Druid spell
list|spells|class=Druid}.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice
from the {@filter Druid spell list|spells|class=Druid}, as shown in the Cantrips
column of the Druid Features table.

### Spell Slots

The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level
1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the {@filter Druid spell
list|spells|class=Druid}. {@spell Animal Friendship|XPHB}, {@spell Cure
Wounds|XPHB}, {@spell Faerie Fire|XPHB}, and {@spell Thunderwave|XPHB} are
recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown
in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number
increases, choose additional spells from the {@filter Druid spell
list|spells|class=Druid} until the number of spells on your list matches the
number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared
spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those
spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can change your list of
prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which
you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a {@item Druidic Focus|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Druid spells."""
