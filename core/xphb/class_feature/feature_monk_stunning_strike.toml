Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an {@variantrule Unarmed
Strike|XPHB}, you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The
target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has
the {@condition Stunned|XPHB} condition until the start of your next turn. On a
successful save, the target's {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is halved until the
start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before
then has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB}."""
