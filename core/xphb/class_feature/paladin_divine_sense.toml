As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can open your awareness to detect
Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition, you know the location of any creature of those
types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the
