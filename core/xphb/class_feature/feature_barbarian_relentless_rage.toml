description = """
Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB} while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a {@dc
10} Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB} instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you
finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB},
the DC resets to 10."""
