You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that
grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you
gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

#### Breaking Your Oath
>> A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most
>> dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.
>> 
>> A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night
>> vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness,
>> the Paladin starts fresh.
>> 
>> If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin
>> should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and
>> adopt another one."""
