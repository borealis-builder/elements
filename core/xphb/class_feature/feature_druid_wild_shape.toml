name = "Wild Shape"
source = "XPHB"
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borealis-builder/elements/main/core/xphb/class_feature/druid_wild_shape.toml"
description = """
The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this
feature (see "Known Forms" below). You stay in that form for a number of hours
equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}.

### Number of Uses

You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB}, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the
Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.

### Known Forms

You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks
that have a maximum {@variantrule Challenge Rating|XPHB} of 1/4 and that lack a {@variantrule Fly
Speed|XPHB} (see appendix B for stat block options). The {@creature Rat|XMM}, {@creature Riding
Horse|XMM}, {@creature Spider|XMM}, and {@creature Wolf|XMM} are recommended.
Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can replace one of your
known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum {@variantrule Challenge
Rating|XPHB} for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In
addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a {@variantrule Fly
Speed|XPHB}.

When choosing known forms, you may look in the {@book Monster Manual|XMM} or
elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.

**Beast Shapes**

| Druid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 4 | {@filter 1/4|bestiary|challenge rating=[&0;&1/4]|type=beast|speed type=!fly|miscellaneous=!swarm} | No |
| 4 | 6 | {@filter 1/2|bestiary|challenge rating=[&0;&1/2]|type=beast|speed type=!fly|miscellaneous=!swarm} | No |
| 8 | 8 | {@filter 1|bestiary|challenge rating=[&0;&1]|type=beast|miscellaneous=!swarm} | Yes |


### Rules While Shape-Shifted

While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak,
and the following rules apply:

- **Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit
Points|XPHB} equal to your Druid level.
- **Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your
creature type; {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}; {@variantrule Hit Point
Dice|XPHB}; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features;
languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies
and use your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus} for them, in
addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving
throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in
the stat block.
- **No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your {@status
Concentration|XPHB} or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.
- **Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than
your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space,
merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal,
but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of
equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change
size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't
wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that
merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form."""
