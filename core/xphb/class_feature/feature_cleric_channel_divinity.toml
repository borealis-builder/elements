description = """
You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical
effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of
which is described below. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity,
choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain
additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended
uses when you finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB}, and you regain all
expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. You gain
additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel
Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell
save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.
