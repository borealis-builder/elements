Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary
energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk
level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points
column of the Monk Features table.

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start
knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the
Wind, each of which is detailed below.

When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, at the end of which you
regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw.
The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}.
