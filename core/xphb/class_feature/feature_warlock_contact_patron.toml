In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you
can communicate directly; you always have the {@spell Contact Other Plane|XPHB}
spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a
spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell's
saving throw.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again
until you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."""
