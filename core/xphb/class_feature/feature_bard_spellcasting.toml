You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See {@book chapter
7|XPHB|7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the {@filter Bard spell
list|spells|class=Bard} later in the class's description.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the {@filter Bard spell
list|spells|class=Bard}. {@spell Dancing Lights|XPHB} and {@spell Vicious
Mockery|XPHB} are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with
another cantrip of your choice from the {@filter Bard spell
list|spells|class=Bard}.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice
from the {@filter Bard spell list|spells|class=Bard}, as shown in the Cantrips
column of the Bard Features table.

### Spell Slots

The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level
1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the {@filter Bard spell
list|spells|class=Bard}. {@spell Charm Person|XPHB}, {@spell Color Spray|XPHB}, {@spell Dissonant
Whispers|XPHB}, and {@spell Healing Word|XPHB} are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in
the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number
increases, choose additional spells from the {@filter Bard spell
list|spells|class=Bard} until the number of spells on your list matches the
number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells
can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those
spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a {@item Musical Instrument|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Bard spells."""
