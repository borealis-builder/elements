description = """
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain
magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity
unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See {@book chapter
7|XPHB|7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the {@filter Warlock spell
list|spells|class=Warlock} later in the class's description.

### Cantrips

You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. {@spell Eldritch Blast|XPHB} and {@spell
Prestidigitation|XPHB} are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you
can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip
of your choice.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of
your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.

### Spell Slots

The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots,
all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots
when you finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

For example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To
cast the level 1 spell {@spell Witch Bolt|XPHB}, you must spend one of those
slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. {@spell Charm
Person|XPHB} and {@spell Hex|XPHB} are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown
in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on
your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level
no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be
of levels 1–3.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those
spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an {@item Arcane Focus|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Warlock spells."""
