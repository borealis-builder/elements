You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability
check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success.
Rather than regaining {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, you roll {@dice 1d10} and
add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a
success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn't expended."""
