description = """
If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on
one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack
roll mustn't have {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB}. If the chosen attack roll
hits, the target takes an extra {@damage 1d10} damage of the same type dealt by
the weapon or {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB}, and you can cause one Brutal
Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

### Forceful Blow

The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to
half your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} straight toward the target without provoking {@action Opportunity Attack|XPHB|Opportunity
Attacks}.

### Hamstring Blow

The target's {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is reduced by 15 feet until the start of
your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a
time—the most recent one."""
