description = """
You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This
inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a {@dice
d6}.

### Using Bardic Inspiration

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can inspire another creature within
60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your
Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at
a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a {@variantrule D20
Test|XPHB}, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number
rolled to the {@dice d20}, potentially turning the failure into a success. A
Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.

### Number of Uses

You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### At Higher Levels

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown
in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a {@dice
d8} at level 5, a {@dice d10} at level 10, and a {@dice d12} at level 15."""
