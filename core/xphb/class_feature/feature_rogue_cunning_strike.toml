You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak
Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each
effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must
forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect
occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add
the Poison effect, remove {@dice 1d6} from the Sneak Attack's damage before
rolling.

If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your
Dexterity modifier and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}.
