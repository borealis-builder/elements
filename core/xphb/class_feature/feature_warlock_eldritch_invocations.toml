description = """
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that
imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one
invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described
in the "{@filter Eldritch Invocation Options|optionalfeatures|feature
type=EI|source=XPHB}" section later in this class's description.

### Prerequisites

If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation.
For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can
select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

### Replacing and Gaining Invocations

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with
another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a
prerequisite for another invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice,
as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.

You can't pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says
otherwise."""
