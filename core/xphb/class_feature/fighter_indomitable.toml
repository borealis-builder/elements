If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter
level. You must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you
finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

You can use this feature twice before a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB} starting
at level 13 and three times before a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB} starting at
