An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering
magic. As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can unleash that magic for 1
minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

- The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
- You have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells
you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you
finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."""
