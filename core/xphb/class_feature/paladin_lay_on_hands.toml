Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that
replenishes when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. With that pool, you
can restore a total number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to five times
your Paladin level.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can touch a creature (which could be
yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB} to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} from the pool of healing
power to remove the {@condition Poisoned|XPHB} condition from the creature;
those points don't also restore {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} to the creature."""
