description = """
You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you
have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your
Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of
Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them."""
