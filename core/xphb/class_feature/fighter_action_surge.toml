You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you
can take one additional action, except the {@action Magic|XPHB} action.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. Starting at level 17, you can
use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn."""
