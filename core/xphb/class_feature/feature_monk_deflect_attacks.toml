description = """
When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or
Slashing damage, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to reduce the
attack's total damage against you. The reduction equals {@dice 1d10} plus your
Dexterity modifier and Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of
the attack's force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of
yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60
feet of yourself that isn't behind {@variantrule Cover|XPHB|Total Cover} if the
attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your
Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack."""
