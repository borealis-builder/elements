description = """
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn,
you can deal an extra {@damage 1d6} damage to one creature you hit with an
attack roll if you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on the roll and the attack
uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the
weapon's type.

You don't need {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on the attack roll if at least one
of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition, and you don't have {@variantrule
Disadvantage|XPHB} on the attack roll.

The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak
Attack column of the Rogue Features table."""
