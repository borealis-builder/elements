You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient
tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always
have the {@spell Speak with Animals|XPHB} spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic
automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a
successful {@dc 15} Intelligence ({@skill Investigation|XPHB}) check but can't
decipher it without magic."""
