Because your magic flows from within you, you can alter your spells to suit your
needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from the "{@filter Metamagic Options|optionalfeatures|feature
type=MM|source=XPHB}" section later in this class's description.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless
otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic
options with one you don't know."""
