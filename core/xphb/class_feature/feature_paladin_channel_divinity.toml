description = """
You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel
magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is
described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect
options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which
effect from this class to create.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended
uses when you finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB}, and you regain all
expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. You gain an
additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell
save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.
