As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can expend one use of this class's Channel
Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your {@item Holy
Symbol|XPHB} or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of
yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the {@condition
Frightened|XPHB} condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While {@condition
Frightened|XPHB} in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its
turns: move, take an action, or take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}."""
