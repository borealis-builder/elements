As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you point your {@item Holy Symbol|XPHB} at
another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy
at it. Roll {@dice 1d8} and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB} to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or
Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the
creature takes half as much damage (round down).

You roll an additional {@dice d8} when you reach Cleric levels 7 ({@dice 2d8}),
13 ({@dice 3d8}), and 18 ({@dice 4d8})."""
