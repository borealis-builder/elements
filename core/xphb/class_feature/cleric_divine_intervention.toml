You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a {@action

require a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to cast. As part of the same action, you
cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components.
You can't use this feature again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
