Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom
modifier (minimum of {@dice 1d8}) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that
fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage
equal to the roll's total. This damage doesn't end the turn effect."""
