You've learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a
Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard
Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from
the {@filter Bard|spells|class=Bard}, {@filter Cleric|spells|class=Cleric}, {@filter
Druid|spells|class=Druid}, and {@filter Wizard spell list|spells|class=Wizard}s,
and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class's section for
its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this
class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists."""
