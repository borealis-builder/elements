You always have the {@spell Hunter's Mark|XPHB} spell prepared. You can cast it
twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this
ability when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when
you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the
