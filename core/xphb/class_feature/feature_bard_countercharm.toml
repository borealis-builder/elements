You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects.
If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an
effect that applies the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} or {@condition
Frightened|XPHB} condition, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to cause
the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB}."""
