description = """
You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you
finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB}, you can choose expended spell slots to
recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half
your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.
For example, if you're a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels' worth
of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell
slots.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
