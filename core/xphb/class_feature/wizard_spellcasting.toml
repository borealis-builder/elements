description = """
As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See {@book chapter
7|XPHB|7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the {@filter Wizard spell
list|spells|class=Wizard} later in the class's description.

### Cantrips

You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. {@spell Light|XPHB}, {@spell Mage
Hand|XPHB}, and {@spell Ray of Frost|XPHB} are recommended. Whenever you finish
a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can replace one of your cantrips from this
feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your
choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.

### Spellbook

Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your
spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can
be read only by you or someone casting {@spell Identify|XPHB}. You determine the
book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of
vellum bound with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1
Wizard spells of your choice. {@spell Detect Magic|XPHB}, {@spell Feather
Fall|XPHB}, {@spell Mage Armor|XPHB}, {@spell Magic Missile|XPHB}, {@spell
Sleep|XPHB}, and {@spell Thunderwave|XPHB} are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice
to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the
culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

### Spell Slots

The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level
1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown
in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number
increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your
list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination,
chosen from your spellbook.

If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those
spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can change your list of
prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your
spellbook.

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an {@item Arcane Focus|XPHB} or your spellbook as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Wizard spells.

#### Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook
>> The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing
>> magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that
>> you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a {@item Spell
>> Scroll|XDMG}, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.
>> 
>> ### Copying a Spell into the Book
>> 
>> When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if
>> it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level
>> of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can
>> prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.
>> 
>> ### Copying the Book
>> 
>> You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying
>> a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast
>> the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied
>> spell.
>> 
>> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the
>> Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the
>> remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this
>> reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook."""
