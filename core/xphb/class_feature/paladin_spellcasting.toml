description = """
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See {@book chapter
7|XPHB|7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the {@filter Paladin spell
list|spells|class=Paladin} later in the class's description.

### Spell Slots

The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose two {@filter level 1 Paladin
spells|spells|class=Paladin|level=1}. {@spell Heroism|XPHB} and {@spell Searing
Smite|XPHB} are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown
in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on
your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a
level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of
level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those
spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can replace one spell
on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a {@item Holy Symbol|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Paladin spells."""
