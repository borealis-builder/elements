description = """
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See {@book chapter
7|XPHB|7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the {@filter Cleric spell
list|spells|class=Cleric} later in the class's description.

### Cantrips

You know three cantrips of your choice from the {@filter Cleric spell
list|spells|class=Cleric}. {@spell Guidance|XPHB}, {@spell Sacred Flame|XPHB},
and {@spell Thaumaturgy|XPHB} are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with
another cantrip of your choice from the {@filter Cleric spell
list|spells|class=Cleric}.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice
from the {@filter Cleric spell list|spells|class=Cleric}, as shown in the
Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.

### Spell Slots

The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level
1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the {@filter Cleric spell
list|spells|class=Cleric}. {@spell Bless|XPHB}, {@spell Cure Wounds|XPHB}, {@spell Guiding
Bolt|XPHB}, and {@spell Shield of Faith|XPHB} are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown
in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number
increases, choose additional spells from the {@filter Cleric spell
list|spells|class=Cleric} until the number of spells on your list matches the
number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared
spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those
spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can change your list of
prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for
which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a {@item Holy Symbol|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Cleric spells."""
