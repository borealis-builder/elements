description = """
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See {@book chapter
7|XPHB|7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the {@filter Sorcerer spell
list|spells|class=Sorcerer} later in the class's description.

### Cantrips

You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. {@spell Light|XPHB}, {@spell
Prestidigitation|XPHB}, {@spell Shocking Grasp|XPHB}, and {@spell Sorcerous
Burst|XPHB} are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace
one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your
choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of
your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

### Spell Slots

The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. {@spell Burning
Hands|XPHB} and {@spell Detect Magic|XPHB} are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as
shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever
that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of
spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The
chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if
you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer
spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared,
those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an {@item Arcane Focus|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Sorcerer spells."""
