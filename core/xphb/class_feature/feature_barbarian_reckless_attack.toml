You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity.
When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack
recklessly. Doing so gives you {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on attack rolls
using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you
have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} during that time."""
