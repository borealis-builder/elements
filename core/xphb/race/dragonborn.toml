### Draconic Ancestry

Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the
Draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and {@variantrule
Damage|XPHB} {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} traits as well as your appearance.

**Draconic Ancestors**

| Dragon | Damage Type |
| --- | --- |
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |


### Breath Weapon

When you take the {@action Attack|XPHB} action on your turn, you can replace one
of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot {@variantrule Cone [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Cone} or a 30-foot {@variantrule Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Line}
that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area
must make a Dexterity saving throw ({@dc 8} plus your Constitution modifier and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}). On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 1d10} damage of the type
determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature
takes half as much damage. This damage increases by {@damage 1d10} when you
reach character levels 5 ({@damage 2d10}), 11 ({@damage 3d10}), and 17 ({@damage
4d10}).

You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Damage Resistance

You have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to the damage type determined by your
Draconic Ancestry trait.

### Darkvision

You have {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} with a range of 60 feet.

### Draconic Flight

When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give
yourself temporary flight. As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you sprout
spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the
wings (no action required) or have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB}
condition. During that time, you have a {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} equal to
your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy
as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you
finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."""
