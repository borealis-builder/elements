### Giant Ancestry

You are descended from Giants. Choose one of the following benefits—a
supernatural boon from your ancestry; you can use the chosen benefit a number of
times equal to your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}:

- **Cloud's Jaunt (Cloud Giant).** As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you magically teleport up to 30 feet to
an unoccupied space you can see.
- **Fire's Burn (Fire Giant).** When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also
deal {@damage 1d10} Fire damage to that target.
- **Frost's Chill (Frost Giant).** When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also
deal {@damage 1d6} Cold damage to that target and reduce its {@variantrule
Speed|XPHB} by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
- **Hill's Tumble (Hill Giant).** When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack roll and deal damage to
it, you can give that target the {@condition Prone|XPHB} condition.
- **Stone's Endurance (Stone Giant).** When you take damage, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to roll {@dice
1d12}. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage
by that total.
- **Storm's Thunder (Storm Giant).** When you take damage from a creature within 60 feet of you, you can take a {@variantrule
Reaction|XPHB} to deal {@damage 1d8} Thunder damage to that creature.

### Large Form

Starting at character level 5, you can change your size to Large as a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB} if you're in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10
minutes or until you end it (no action required). For that duration, you have {@variantrule
Advantage|XPHB} on Strength checks, and your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} increases
by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Powerful Build

You have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on any ability check you make to end the {@condition
Grappled|XPHB} condition. You also count as one size larger when determining
your carrying capacity."""
