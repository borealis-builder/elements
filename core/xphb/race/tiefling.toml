### Darkvision

You have {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} with a range of 60 feet.

### Fiendish Legacy

You are the recipient of a legacy that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose
a legacy from the Fiendish Legacies table. You gain the level 1 benefit of the
chosen legacy.

When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a higher-level spell, as
shown on the table. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once
without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you
finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. You can also cast the spell using any
spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the
ability when you select the legacy).

**Fiendish Legacies**

| Legacy | Level 1 | Level 3 | Level 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Abyssal | You have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Poison damage. You also know the {@spell Poison Spray|XPHB} cantrip. | {@spell Ray of Sickness|XPHB} | {@spell Hold Person|XPHB} |
| Chthonic | You have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Necrotic damage. You also know the {@spell Chill Touch|XPHB} cantrip. | {@spell False Life|XPHB} | {@spell Ray of Enfeeblement|XPHB} |

### Otherworldly Presence

You know the {@spell Thaumaturgy|XPHB} cantrip. When you cast it with this
trait, the spell uses the same spellcasting ability you use for your Fiendish
Legacy Trait."""
