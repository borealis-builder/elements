### Darkvision

You have {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} with a range of 60 feet.

### Gnomish Cunning

You have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
saving throws.

### Gnomish Lineage

You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose one of
the following options; whichever one you choose, Intelligence, Wisdom, or
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait
(choose the ability when you select the lineage):

- **Forest Gnome.** You know the {@spell Minor Illusion|XPHB} cantrip. You also always have the {@spell Speak with
Animals|XPHB} spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot a number of
times equal to your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. You
can also use any spell slots you have to cast the spell.
- **Rock Gnome.** You know the {@spell Mending|XPHB} and {@spell Prestidigitation|XPHB} cantrips.
In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting {@spell Prestidigitation|XPHB} to
create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or
music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing
one effect from {@spell Prestidigitation|XPHB}; the device produces that effect
whenever you or another creature takes a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to
activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose
one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you
choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device
ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three
such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its
creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a {@action Utilize|XPHB}
action."""
