### Adrenaline Rush

You can take the {@action Dash|XPHB} action as a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}. When you do so, you gain a number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit
Points|XPHB} equal to your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

### Darkvision

You have {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} with a range of 120 feet.

### Relentless Endurance

When you are reduced to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} but not killed
outright, you can drop to 1 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} instead.
Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
