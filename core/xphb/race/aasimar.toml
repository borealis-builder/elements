### Celestial Resistance

You have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Necrotic damage and Radiant damage.

### Darkvision

You have {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} with a range of 60 feet.

### Healing Hands

As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you touch a creature and roll a number of d4s
equal to your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}. The creature
regains a number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to the total rolled.
Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Light Bearer

You know the {@spell Light|XPHB} cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability
for it.

### Celestial Revelation

When you reach character level 3, you can transform as a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB} using one of the options below (choose the option each time you
transform). The transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it (no action
required). Once you transform, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

Once on each of your turns before the transformation ends, you can deal extra
damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The
extra damage equals your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}, and
the extra damage's type is either Necrotic for Necrotic Shroud or Radiant for
Heavenly Wings and Inner Radiance.

Here are the transformation options:

- **Heavenly Wings.** Two spectral wings sprout from your back temporarily. Until the transformation
ends, you have a {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} equal to your {@variantrule
Speed|XPHB}.
- **Inner Radiance.** Searing light temporarily radiates from your eyes and mouth. For the duration,
you shed {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 10-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim
Light|XPHB} for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns,
each creature within 10 feet of you takes Radiant damage equal to your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}.
- **Necrotic Shroud.** Your eyes briefly become pools of darkness, and flightless wings sprout from
your back temporarily. Creatures other than your allies within 10 feet of you
must succeed on a Charisma saving throw ({@dc 8} plus your Charisma modifier and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}) or have the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition until the end of your
next turn."""
