### Brave

You have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on saving throws you make to avoid or end
the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition.

### Halfling Nimbleness

You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you,
but you can't stop in the same space.

### Luck

When you roll a 1 on the {@dice d20} of a {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB}, you can
reroll the die, and you must use the new roll.

### Naturally Stealthy

You can take the {@action Hide|XPHB} action even when you are obscured only by a
creature that is at least one size larger than you."""
