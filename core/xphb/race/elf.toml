### Darkvision

You have {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} with a range of 60 feet.

### Elven Lineage

You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose a
lineage from the Elven Lineages table. You gain the level 1 benefit of that
lineage.

When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a higher-level spell, as
shown on the table. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once
without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you
finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. You can also cast the spell using any
spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells
you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage).

**Elven Lineages**

| Lineage | Level 1 | Level 3 | Level 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Drow | The range of your {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} increases to 120 feet. You also know the {@spell Dancing Lights|XPHB} cantrip. | {@spell Faerie Fire|XPHB} | {@spell Darkness|XPHB} |
| High Elf | You know the {@spell Prestidigitation|XPHB} cantrip. Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can replace that cantrip with a different {@filter cantrip from the Wizard spell list|spells|level=0|class=Wizard}. | {@spell Detect Magic|XPHB} | {@spell Misty Step|XPHB} |

Rest|XPHB} in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation,
during which you retain consciousness."""
