As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can imbue your Aura of Protection
with primal power, granting the benefits below for 1 minute or until you end
them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
until you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. You can also restore your use
of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

### Diminish Defiance

Enemies in the aura have {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on saving throws
against your spells and Channel Divinity options.

### Regeneration

At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB}.

### Swift Spells

Whenever you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can cast it
using a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} instead."""
