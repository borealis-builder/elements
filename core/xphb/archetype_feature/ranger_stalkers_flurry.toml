The Psychic damage of your Dreadful Strike becomes {@damage 2d8}. In addition,
when you use the Dreadful Strike effect of your Dread Ambusher feature, you can
cause one of the following additional effects.

### Sudden Strike

You can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature
that is within 5 feet of the original target and that is within the weapon's
range.

### Mass Fear

The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature has the {@condition
Frightened|XPHB} condition until the start of your next turn."""
