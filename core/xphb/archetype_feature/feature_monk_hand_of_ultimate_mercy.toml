description = """
Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a {@action
Magic|XPHB} action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the
past 24 hours and expend 5 Focus Points. The creature then returns to life with
a number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to {@dice 4d10} plus your
Wisdom modifier. If the creature died with any of the following conditions, the
creature revives with the conditions removed: {@condition Blinded|XPHB}, {@condition
Deafened|XPHB}, {@condition Paralyzed|XPHB}, {@condition Poisoned|XPHB}, and {@condition
Stunned|XPHB}.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
