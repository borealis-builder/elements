A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as
a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you
can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one
creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage
equal to {@damage 1d8} plus your Wisdom modifier."""
