You can cast {@spell Summon Fey|XPHB} without a Material component. You can also
cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this
way when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't
require {@status Concentration|XPHB}. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes
1 minute for that casting."""
