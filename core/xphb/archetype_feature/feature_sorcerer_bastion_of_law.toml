description = """
You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a
shimmering shield of order. As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can expend 1
to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature
you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of
d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded
creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and
reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

The ward lasts until you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB} or until you use
this feature again."""
