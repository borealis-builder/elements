Instead of manifesting the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} of Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it
around one willing creature within 60 feet of yourself. That creature gains all
the benefits of the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} and
uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.

In addition, you can manifest the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} around both the other creature and yourself if you
expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when manifesting it."""
