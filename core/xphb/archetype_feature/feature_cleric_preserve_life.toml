As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you present your {@item Holy Symbol|XPHB} and
expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a
number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to five times your Cleric level.
Choose {@status Bloodied|XPHB} creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can
include you), and divide those {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} among them. This
feature can restore a creature to no more than half its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit
