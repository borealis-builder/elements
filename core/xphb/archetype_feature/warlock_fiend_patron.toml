{@i Make a Deal with the Lower Planes}

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a
bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil such as
Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth, or night hag that is especially
mighty. That patron's aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all
things, ultimately including you—and your path is defined by the extent to
which you strive against those aims.
