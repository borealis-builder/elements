A divine entity helps ensure you can continue the fight. You have a pool of four
d12s that you can spend to heal yourself. As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB},
you can expend dice from the pool, roll them, and regain a number of {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB} equal to the roll's total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

The pool's maximum number of dice increases by one when you reach Barbarian
levels 6 (5 dice), 12 (6 dice), and 17 (7 dice)."""
