You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations.
When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see,
you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell's level. The chosen
creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and
they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful
save."""
