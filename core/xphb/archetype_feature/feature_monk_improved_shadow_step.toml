You can draw on your Shadowfell connection to empower your teleportation. When
you use your Shadow Step, you can expend 1 Focus Point to remove the requirement
that you must start and end in {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} or {@variantrule
Darkness|XPHB} for that use of the feature. As part of this {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}, you can make an {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB} immediately
after you teleport."""
