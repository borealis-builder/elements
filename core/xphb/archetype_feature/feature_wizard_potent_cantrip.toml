Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect.
When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the
target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the
cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip."""
