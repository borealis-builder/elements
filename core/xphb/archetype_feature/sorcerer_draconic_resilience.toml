The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit
Point} maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another
Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren't wearing
armor, your base {@variantrule Armor Class|XPHB} equals 10 plus your Dexterity
and Charisma modifiers."""
