As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and
choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and
life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius {@variantrule Sphere [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Sphere} centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the {@variantrule Sphere [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Sphere} must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell
save DC, taking {@damage 2d6} Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much
damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains {@dice
2d6} {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}.

The damage and healing increase by {@dice 1d6} when you reach Druid levels 10 ({@dice
3d6}) and 14 ({@dice 4d6})."""
