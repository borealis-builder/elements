As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape
feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body
becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them
as on a star chart. This form sheds {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a
10-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 10 feet. The
form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required),
have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following
constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits
while in the form.
