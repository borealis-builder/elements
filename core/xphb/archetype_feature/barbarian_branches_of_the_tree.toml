Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while your
Rage is active, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to summon spectral
branches of the World Tree around it. The target must succeed on a Strength
saving throw ({@dc 8} plus your Strength modifier and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}) or be teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of
yourself or in the nearest unoccupied space you can see. After the target
teleports, you can reduce its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} to 0 until the end of
the current turn."""
