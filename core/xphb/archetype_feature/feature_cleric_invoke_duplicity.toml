description = """
As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can expend one use of your Channel
Divinity to create a perfect visual illusion of yourself in an unoccupied space
you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The illusion is intangible and doesn't
occupy its space. It lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no
action required) or have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition. The
illusion is animated and mimics your expressions and gestures. While it
persists, you gain the following benefits.

### Cast Spells

You can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use
your own senses.

### Distract

When both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the
illusion, you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on attack rolls against that
creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

### Move

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet
to an unoccupied space you can see that is within 120 feet of yourself."""
