description = """
You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny
object, and you can use it as a {@variantrule Spellcasting Focus|XPHB} for your
Druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by
choosing one.

While holding the map, you have the {@spell Guidance|XPHB} and {@spell Guiding
Bolt|XPHB} spells prepared, and you can cast {@spell Guiding Bolt|XPHB} without
expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to
your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a
replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, and it destroys the previous
map.
