Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the {@condition
Charmed|XPHB} condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack
roll, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to reduce the damage you take
by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving
throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic
damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this {@variantrule
Reaction|XPHB}, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to
restore your use of it."""
