{@i Bring Light to Banish Darkness}

The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and
revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with
radiance and the power of their deities' discerning vision, charged with chasing
away lies and burning away darkness.

The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight,
and renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers
who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce deception.
Some are deities of beauty and artistry who teach that art is a vehicle for the
soul's improvement.
