You can empower yourself with the legends—whether true or exaggerated—of
your great deeds. As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you gain the benefits
below for 10 minutes. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. You can also restore your use of it
by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

### Charismatic

You are blessed with an otherworldly presence and have {@variantrule
Advantage|XPHB} on all Charisma checks.

### Saving Throw Reroll

If you fail a saving throw, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to
reroll it. You must use this new roll.

### Unerring Strike

Once on each of your turns when you make an attack roll with a weapon and miss,
you can cause that attack to hit instead."""
