{@i Unleash Chaotic Magic}

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of
creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps
through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you
were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke
with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you,
waiting for any outlet.
