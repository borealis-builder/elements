description = """
As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action while entirely within {@variantrule Dim
Light|XPHB} or {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB}, you can expend 3 Focus Points to
shroud yourself with shadows for 1 minute, until you have the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition, or until you end your turn in {@variantrule Bright
Light|XPHB}. While shrouded by these shadows, you gain the following benefits.

### Invisibility

You have the {@condition Invisible|XPHB} condition.

### Partially Incorporeal

You can move through occupied spaces as if they were {@variantrule Difficult
Terrain|XPHB}. If you end your turn in such a space, you are shunted to the last
unoccupied space you were in.

### Shadow Flurry

You can use your Flurry of Blows without expending any Focus Points."""
