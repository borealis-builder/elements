{@i Sing the Deeds of Ancient Heroes}

Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales preserve the
memory of the great heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the mighty
in vaulted halls or to crowds gathered around great bonfires. They travel to
witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of these events
doesn't pass away. With their songs, they inspire new generations to reach the
same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
