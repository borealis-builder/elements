description = """
You have learned to cast spells. See {@book chapter 7|XPHB|7} for the rules on
spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Arcane
Trickster.

### Cantrips

You know three cantrips: {@spell Mage Hand|XPHB} and two other cantrips of your
choice from the {@filter Wizard spell list|spells|class=Wizard} (see that
class's section for its list). {@spell Mind Sliver|XPHB} and {@spell Minor
Illusion|XPHB} are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except {@spell Mage
Hand|XPHB}, with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

### Spell Slots

The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. {@spell Charm
Person|XPHB}, {@spell Disguise Self|XPHB}, and {@spell Fog Cloud|XPHB} are
recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown
in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table.
Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number
of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For
example, if you're a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include
five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an {@item Arcane Focus|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Wizard spells."""
