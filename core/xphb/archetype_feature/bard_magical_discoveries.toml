You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the {@filter
Cleric|spells|class=Cleric}, {@filter Druid|spells|class=Druid}, or {@filter Wizard spell
list|spells|class=Wizard} or any combination thereof (see a class's section for
its spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you
have spell slots, as shown in the Bard Features table.

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level,
you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these
requirements."""
