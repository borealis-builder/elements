You magically transport yourself, reappearing amid a burst of moonlight. As a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, and
you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on the next attack roll you make before
the end of this turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}. You can also regain uses by expending a level 2+ spell slot for each
use you want to restore (no action required)."""
