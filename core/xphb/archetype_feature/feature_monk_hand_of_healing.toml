As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to touch a
creature and restore a number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to a roll
of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier. When you use your Flurry of
Blows, you can replace one of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of this feature
without expending a Focus Point for the healing."""
