description = """
You gain the ability to align your consciousness with the endless calculations
of Mechanus. As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can enter this state for
1 minute. For the duration, attack rolls against you can't benefit from {@variantrule
Advantage|XPHB}, and whenever you make a {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB}, you can
treat a roll of 9 or lower on the {@dice d20} as a 10.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore
your use of it."""
