You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make
an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add {@dice 1d10}
to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll's
effects occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."""
