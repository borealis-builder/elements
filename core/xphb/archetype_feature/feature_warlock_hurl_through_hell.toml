description = """
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to
instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed
on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears
and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes {@damage 8d10}
Psychic damage if it isn't a Fiend, and it has the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns
to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to
restore your use of it."""
