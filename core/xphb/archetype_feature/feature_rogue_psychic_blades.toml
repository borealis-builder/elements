You can manifest shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the {@action
Attack|XPHB} action or make an {@action Opportunity Attack|XPHB}, you can
manifest a {@item Psychic Blade|XPHB} in your free hand and make the attack with
that blade. The magic blade has the following traits:

TODO: Psychic Blade (item) from XPHB

The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves
no mark if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade on your turn, you can make a melee or ranged
attack with a second psychic blade as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on the
same turn if your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus
attack is {@damage 1d4} instead of {@damage 1d6}."""
