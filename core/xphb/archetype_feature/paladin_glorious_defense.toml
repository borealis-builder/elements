description = """
You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can
see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a {@variantrule
Reaction|XPHB} to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack,
potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum
of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one attack with a weapon against the
attacker as part of this {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} if the attacker is within
your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
