description = """
The magic of the Feywild guards your mind. You have {@variantrule
Advantage|XPHB} on saving throws to avoid or end the {@condition Charmed|XPHB}
or {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition.

In addition, whenever you or a creature you can see within 120 feet of you
succeeds on a saving throw to avoid or end the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} or {@condition
Frightened|XPHB} condition, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to force
a different creature you can see within 120 feet of yourself to make a Wisdom
save against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is {@condition
Charmed|XPHB} or {@condition Frightened|XPHB} (your choice) for 1 minute. The
target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success."""
