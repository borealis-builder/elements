You always have the {@spell Charm Person|XPHB} and {@spell Mirror Image|XPHB}
spells prepared.

In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using a
spell slot, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to
make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the
target has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} or {@condition Frightened|XPHB}
condition (your choice) for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}. You can also restore your use of it by expending one use of your
Bardic Inspiration (no action required)."""
