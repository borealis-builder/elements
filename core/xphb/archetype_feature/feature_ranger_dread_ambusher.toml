You have mastered the art of creating fearsome ambushes, granting you the
following benefits.

### Ambusher's Leap

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}
increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

### Dreadful Strike

When you attack a creature and hit it with a weapon, you can deal an extra {@damage
2d6} Psychic damage. You can use this benefit only once per turn, you can use it
a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

### Initiative Bonus

When you roll {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB}, you can add your Wisdom modifier
to the roll."""
