description = """
You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon.
You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB}. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the
conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. The bond fails if
another Fighter is bonded to the weapon or if the weapon is a magic item to
which someone else is attuned.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon
unless you have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition. If it is on the
same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but you can summon only one at a time
with a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}. If you attempt to bond with a third
weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two."""
