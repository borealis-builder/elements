You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic drawn from the
murky hollows of the Feywild. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can
deal an extra {@damage 1d4} Psychic damage to the target, which can take this
extra damage only once per turn. The extra damage increases to {@damage 1d6}
when you reach Ranger level 11."""
