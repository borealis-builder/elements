description = """
You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another.
As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, choose one creature you can see within 30
feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically
with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other,
you each must mentally use a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock
level. It ends early if you use this feature to connect with a different
creature."""
