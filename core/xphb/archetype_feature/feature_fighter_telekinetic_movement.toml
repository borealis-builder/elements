You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As a {@action Magic|XPHB}
action, choose one target you can see within 30 feet of yourself; the target
must be a loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature other
than you. You transport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can
see. Alternatively, if the target is a Tiny object, you can transport it to or
from your hand.

Once you take this action, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a Psionic
Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it."""
