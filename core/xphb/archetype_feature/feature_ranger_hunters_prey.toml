You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you
finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB},
you can replace the chosen option with the other one.

### Colossus Slayer

Your tenacity can wear down even the most resilient foes. When you hit a
creature with a weapon, the weapon deals an extra {@damage 1d8} damage to the
target if it's missing any of its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. You can deal
this extra damage only once per turn.

### Horde Breaker

Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with a weapon, you can make
another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within
5 feet of the original target, that is within the weapon's range, and that you
haven't attacked this turn."""
