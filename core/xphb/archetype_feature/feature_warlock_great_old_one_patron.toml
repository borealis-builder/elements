{@i Unearth Forbidden Lore of Ineffable Beings}

When you choose this subclass, you might bind yourself to an unspeakable being
from the Far Realm or an elder god—a being such as Tharizdun, the Chained God;
Zargon, the Returner; Hadar, the Dark Hunger; or Great Cthulhu. Or you might
invoke several entities without yoking yourself to one. The motives of these
beings are incomprehensible, and the Great Old One might be indifferent to your
existence. But the secrets you've learned nevertheless allow you to draw strange
magic from it.
