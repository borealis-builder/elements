{@i Call on the Power of the Heavens}

Your pact draws on the Upper Planes, the realms of everlasting bliss. You might
enter an agreement with an empyrean, a couatl, a sphinx, a unicorn, or another
heavenly entity. Or you might call on numerous such beings as you pursue goals
aligned with theirs. Your pact allows you to experience a hint of the holy light
that illuminates the multiverse.
