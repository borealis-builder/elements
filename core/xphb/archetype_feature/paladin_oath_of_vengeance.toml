{@i Punish Evildoers at Any Cost}

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed
grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a
tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent,
when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins
arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Show the wicked no mercy.
- Fight injustice and its causes.
- Aid those harmed by injustice.
