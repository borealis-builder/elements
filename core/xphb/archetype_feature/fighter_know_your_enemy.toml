As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can discern certain strengths and
weaknesses of a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself; you know
whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and
if the creature has any, you know what they are.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}. You can also restore a use of the feature by expending one
Superiority Die (no action required)."""
