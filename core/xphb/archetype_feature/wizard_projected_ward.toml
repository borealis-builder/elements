When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself takes damage, you
can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that
damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, the
warded creature takes any remaining damage. If that creature has any Resistances
or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward's {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB}."""
