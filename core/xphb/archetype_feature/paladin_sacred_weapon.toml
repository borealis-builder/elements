description = """
When you take the {@action Attack|XPHB} action, you can expend one use of your
Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive
energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your
Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of
+1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type
or Radiant damage.

The weapon also emits {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 20-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim
Light|XPHB} 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you
aren't carrying the weapon."""
