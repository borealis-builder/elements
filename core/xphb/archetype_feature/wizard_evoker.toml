{@i Create Explosive Elemental Effects}

Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as
bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning
acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to
blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some
seek their own gain.
