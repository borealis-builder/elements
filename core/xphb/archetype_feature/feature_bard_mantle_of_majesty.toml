You always have the {@spell Command|XPHB} spell prepared.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you cast {@spell Command|XPHB} without
expending a spell slot, and you take on an unearthly appearance for 1 minute or
until your {@status Concentration|XPHB} ends. During this time, you can cast {@spell
Command|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} without expending a spell
slot.

Any creature {@condition Charmed|XPHB} by you automatically fails its saving
throw against the {@spell Command|XPHB} you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 3+ spell
slot (no action required)."""
