Your Rage taps into the life force of the World Tree. You gain the following
benefits.

### Vitality Surge

When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit
Points|XPHB} equal to your Barbarian level.

### Life-Giving Force

At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can choose
another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain {@variantrule Temporary Hit
Points|XPHB}. To determine the number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit
Points|XPHB}, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them
together. If any of these {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} remain when
your Rage ends, they vanish."""
