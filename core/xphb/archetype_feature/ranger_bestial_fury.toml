When you command your Primal Companion beast to take the Beast's Strike action,
the beast can use it twice.

In addition, the first time each turn it hits a creature under the effect of
your {@spell Hunter's Mark|XPHB} spell, the beast deals extra Force damage equal
to the bonus damage of that spell."""
