{@i Become One with Tides and Storms}

Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and
storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature's wrath, seeking vengeance
against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by
attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of
currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the
winds.
