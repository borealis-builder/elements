You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following
benefits.

### Attunement

You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

### Charges

Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll {@dice 1d6}.
On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

### Scrolls

You can use any {@item Spell Scroll|XDMG}, using Intelligence as your
spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1
spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell,
you must first succeed on an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana|XPHB}) check ({@dc 10}
plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the
scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates."""
