As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can cause draconic wings to appear on
your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action
required). For the duration, you have a {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} of 60
feet.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore
your use of it."""
