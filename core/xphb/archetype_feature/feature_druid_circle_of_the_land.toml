{@i Celebrate Connection to the Natural World}

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient
knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or
standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest
members preside as the chief priests of their communities.
