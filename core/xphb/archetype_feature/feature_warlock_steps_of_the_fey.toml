Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes.
You can cast {@spell Misty Step|XPHB} without expending a spell slot a number of
times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all
expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following
additional effects.

### Refreshing Step

Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet
of yourself gains {@dice 1d10} {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB}.

### Taunting Step

Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw against your spell save DC or have {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on
attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn."""
