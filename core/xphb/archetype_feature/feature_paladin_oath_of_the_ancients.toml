{@i Preserve Life and Light in the World}

The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first elves. Paladins who swear this
oath cherish the light; they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the
world more than any principles of honor, courage, and justice. They often adorn
their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or
flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Kindle the light of hope.
- Shelter life.
- Delight in art and laughter.
