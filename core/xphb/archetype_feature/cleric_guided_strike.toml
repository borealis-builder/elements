When you or a creature within 30 feet of you misses with an attack roll, you can
expend one use of your Channel Divinity and give that roll a +10 bonus,
potentially causing it to hit. When you use this feature to benefit another
creature's attack roll, you must take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to do so."""
