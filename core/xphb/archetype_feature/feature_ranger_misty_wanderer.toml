You can cast {@spell Misty Step|XPHB} without expending a spell slot. You can do
so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

In addition, whenever you cast {@spell Misty Step|XPHB}, you can bring along one
willing creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. That creature teleports
to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of your destination space."""
