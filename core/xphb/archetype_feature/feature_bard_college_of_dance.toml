{@i Move in Harmony with the Cosmos}

Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can't be contained
within speech or song; the words are uttered by the movements of celestial
bodies and flow through the motions of the smallest creatures. These Bards
practice a way of being in harmony with the whirling cosmos that emphasizes
agility, speed, and grace.
