Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction
of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a Divination spell using a level 2+
spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a
level lower than the slot you expended and can't be higher than level 5."""
