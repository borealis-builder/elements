Glimpses of the future begin to press on your awareness. Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any {@variantrule D20
Test|XPHB} made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these
foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace
a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}, you lose any unused foretelling rolls."""
