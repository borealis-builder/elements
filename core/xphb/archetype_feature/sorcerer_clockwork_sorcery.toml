{@i Channel Cosmic Forces of Order}

The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from
Mechanus or a realm like it—a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork
efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the
machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your
ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within
you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it's part of a
vast and glorious system.
