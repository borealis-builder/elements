You can cast Illusion spells without providing Verbal components, and if an
Illusion spell you cast has a range of 10+ feet, the range increases by 60 feet.

You also know the {@spell Minor Illusion|XPHB} cantrip. If you already know it,
you learn a different Wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count
against your number of cantrips known. You can create both a sound and an image
with a single casting of {@spell Minor Illusion|XPHB}, and you can cast it as a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}."""
