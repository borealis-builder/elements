Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a
creature with an {@action Opportunity Attack|XPHB}, you can reduce the
creature's {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} to 0 until the end of the current turn. You
can then move up to half your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} as part of the same {@variantrule
Reaction|XPHB}. This movement doesn't provoke {@action Opportunity Attack|XPHB|Opportunity
Attacks}."""
