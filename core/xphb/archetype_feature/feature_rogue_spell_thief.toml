description = """
You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell
from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in
its area of effect, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to force the
creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC.
On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the
knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it
doesn't need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell
prepared. The creature can't cast it until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you steal a spell with this feature, you can't use this feature again until
you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."""
