description = """
As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape
to manifest a 5-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation}
that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends
early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition.

When you manifest the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation}
and as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on your subsequent turns, you can
choose another creature you can see in the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Emanation}. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
against your spell save DC or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or
smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a
number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die)."""
