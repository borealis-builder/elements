Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot, you can create an
effect of your choice from the {@table Wild Magic Surge|XPHB} table instead of
rolling on that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the
final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
