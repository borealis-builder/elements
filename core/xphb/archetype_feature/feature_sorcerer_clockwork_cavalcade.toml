description = """
You momentarily summon spirits of order to expunge disorder around you. As a {@action
Magic|XPHB} action, you summon the spirits in a 30-foot {@variantrule Cube [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Cube} originating from you. The spirits look like modrons or other
Constructs of your choice. The spirits are intangible and invulnerable, and they
create the effects below within the {@variantrule Cube [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Cube} before vanishing. Once you use this action, you can't use it
again until you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB} unless you spend 7
Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Heal

The spirits restore up to 100 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, divided as you
choose among any number of creatures of your choice in the {@variantrule Cube [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Cube}.

### Repair

Any damaged objects entirely in the {@variantrule Cube [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Cube} are repaired instantly.

### Dispel

Every spell of level 6 and lower ends on creatures and objects of your choice in
the {@variantrule Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cube}."""
