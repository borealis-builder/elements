description = """
When you activate your Rage, you can assume the form of a divine warrior. This
form lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}.
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

While in this form, you gain the benefits below.

### Flight

You have a {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} equal to your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}
and can hover.

### Resistance

You have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant
damage.

### Revivification

When a creature within 30 feet of you would drop to 0 {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB}, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to expend a use of
your Rage to instead change the target's {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} to a
number equal to your Barbarian level."""
