description = """
You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic
Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects.

### Defense

When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its {@variantrule
Reaction|XPHB} to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to
its AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

### Offense

Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature
can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the attack's
damage against the target."""
