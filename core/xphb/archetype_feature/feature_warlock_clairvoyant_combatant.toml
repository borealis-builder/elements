description = """
When you form a telepathic bond with a creature using your Awakened Mind, you
can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
DC. On a failed save, the creature has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on
attack rolls against you, and you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on attack
rolls against that creature for the duration of the bond.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a Pact Magic
spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it."""
