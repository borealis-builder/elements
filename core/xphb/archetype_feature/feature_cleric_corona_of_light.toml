description = """
As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you cause yourself to emit an aura of sunlight
that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You emit {@variantrule Bright
Light|XPHB} in a 60-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an
additional 30 feet. Your enemies in the {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} have {@variantrule
Disadvantage|XPHB} on saving throws against your Radiance of the Dawn and any
spell that deals Fire or Radiant damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
