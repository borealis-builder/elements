{@i Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds}

Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar magic to transform themselves.
Their order gathers under the moon to share news and perform rituals.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one
night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and then crash through
undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the
Druid's blood.
