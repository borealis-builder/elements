description = """
Your experience on the battlefield has refined your fighting techniques. You
learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called Superiority Dice.

### Maneuvers

You learn three maneuvers of your choice from the "{@filter Maneuvers Options|optionalfeatures|feature
type=MV:B|source=XPHB}" section later in this subclass's description. Many
maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per
attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice when you reach Fighter levels
7, 10, and 15. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one
maneuver you know with a different one.

### Superiority Dice

You have four Superiority Dice, which are {@dice d8|d8s}. A Superiority Die is
expended when you use it. You regain all expended Superiority Dice when you
finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

You gain an additional Superiority Die when you reach Fighter levels 7 (five
dice total) and 15 (six dice total).

### Saving Throws

If a maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Strength or
Dexterity modifier (your choice) and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}."""
