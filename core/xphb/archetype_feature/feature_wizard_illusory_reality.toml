description = """
You have learned to weave shadow magic into your illusions to give them a
semi-reality. When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose
one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that
object real. You can do this on your turn as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}
while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute, during which
it can't deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create an
illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real and cross it."""
