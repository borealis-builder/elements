When you are reduced to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} and not killed
outright, you can drop to 1 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} instead,
and you regain a number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to three times
your Paladin level. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you
finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

Additionally, you can't be aged magically, and you cease visibly aging."""
