The power of the moon suffuses you, granting you the following benefits.

### Improved Lunar Radiance

Once per turn, you can deal an extra {@damage 2d10} Radiant damage to a target
you hit with a Wild Shape form's attack.

### Shared Moonlight

Whenever you use Moonlight Step, you can also teleport one willing creature.
That creature must be within 10 feet of you, and you teleport it to an
unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of your destination space."""
