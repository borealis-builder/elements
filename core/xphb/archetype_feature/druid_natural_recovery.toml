You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle
Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} before you do so again.

In addition, when you finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB}, you can choose
expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that
is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can
be level 6+. For example, if you're a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three
levels' worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2
and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell
slots with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
