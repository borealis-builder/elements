Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can consult your Star
Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}, you gain access to a special {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} based on
whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

- **Weal (even).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a {@variantrule D20
Test|XPHB}, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to roll {@dice 1d6} and
add the number rolled to the total.
- **Woe (odd).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a {@variantrule D20
Test|XPHB}, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to roll {@dice 1d6} and
subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} a number of times equal to your
Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."""
