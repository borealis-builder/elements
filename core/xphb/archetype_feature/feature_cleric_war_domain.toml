{@i Inspire Valor and Smite Foes}

War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be
desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances
of excellence and courage. Clerics who tap into the magic of the War Domain
excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of
violence as prayers.

Gods of the War Domain watch over warriors and reward them for their great
deeds. They include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of
destruction and pillage. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting
war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.
