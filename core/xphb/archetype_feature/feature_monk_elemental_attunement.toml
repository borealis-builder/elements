At the start of your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to imbue yourself with
elemental energy. The energy lasts for 10 minutes or until you have the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition. You gain the following benefits while this
feature is active.

### Reach

When you make an {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB}, your reach is 10 feet
greater than normal, as elemental energy extends from you.

### Elemental Strikes

Whenever you hit with your {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB}, you can cause it
to deal your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage rather
than its normal damage type. When you deal one of these types with it, you can
also force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can
move the target up to 10 feet toward or away from you, as elemental energy
swirls around it."""
