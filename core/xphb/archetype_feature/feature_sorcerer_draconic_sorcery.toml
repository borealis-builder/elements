{@i Breathe the Magic of Dragons}

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon
facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You
might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons' power. Or perhaps
you handled a treasure taken from a dragon's hoard that was steeped in draconic
power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.
