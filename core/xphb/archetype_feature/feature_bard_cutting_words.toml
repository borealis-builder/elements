You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap
the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within
60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or
attack roll, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to expend one use of
your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the
number rolled from the creature's roll, reducing the damage or potentially
turning the success into a failure."""
