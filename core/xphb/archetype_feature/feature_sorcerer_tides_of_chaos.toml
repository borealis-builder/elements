You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB}
on one {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB} before you roll the {@dice d20}. Once you do
so, you must cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot or finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} before you can use this feature again.

If you do cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot before you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}, you automatically roll on the {@table Wild Magic Surge|XPHB} table."""
