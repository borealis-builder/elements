You always have the {@spell Telekinesis|XPHB} spell prepared. With this feature,
you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting
ability for it is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you maintain {@status
Concentration|XPHB} on it, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one
attack with a weapon as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again
until you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a Psionic
Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it."""
