You always have the {@spell Counterspell|XPHB} and {@spell Dispel Magic|XPHB}
spells prepared. In addition, you can cast {@spell Dispel Magic|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}, and you can add your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus} to its ability check.

When you cast either spell with a spell slot, that slot isn't expended if the
spell fails to stop a spell."""
