You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your Unarmed
Strikes. When you deal damage with an {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB}, you
can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus
your Dexterity modifier, instead of the strike's normal damage. This roll
doesn't expend the die."""
