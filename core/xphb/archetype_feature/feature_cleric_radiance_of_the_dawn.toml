As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you present your {@item Holy Symbol|XPHB} and
expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit a flash of light in a 30-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from yourself. Any magical {@variantrule
Darkness|XPHB}—such as that created by the {@spell Darkness|XPHB} spell—in
that area is dispelled. Additionally, each creature of your choice in that area
must make a Constitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to {@dice
2d10} plus your Cleric level on a failed save or half as much damage on a
successful one."""
