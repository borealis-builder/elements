You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor. As a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic
Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a number of other creatures within 60
feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one
creature). Each of those creatures gains a number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit
Points|XPHB} equal to two times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die,
and then each can use its {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to move up to its {@variantrule
Speed|XPHB} without provoking {@action Opportunity Attack|XPHB|Opportunity
Attacks}."""
