description = """
You can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature's mind. When you use your
Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that
target to make a Wisdom saving throw ({@dc 8} plus your Dexterity modifier and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency
Bonus}). If the save fails, the target has the {@condition Stunned|XPHB}
condition for 1 minute. The {@condition Stunned|XPHB} target repeats the save at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you expend three Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to
restore your use of it."""
