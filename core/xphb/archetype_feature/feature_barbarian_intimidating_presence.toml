description = """
As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can strike terror into others with
your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your
choice in a 30-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation}
originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw ({@dc 8} plus your Strength
modifier and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}). On a failed
save, a creature has the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} condition for 1 minute. At
the end of each of the {@condition Frightened|XPHB} creature's turns, the
creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore
your use of it."""
