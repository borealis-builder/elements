description = """
You have learned to cast spells. See {@book chapter 7|XPHB|7} for the rules on
spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an
Eldritch Knight.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the {@filter Wizard spell
list|spells|class=Wizard} (see that class's section for its list). {@spell Ray of
Frost|XPHB} and {@spell Shocking Grasp|XPHB} are recommended. Whenever you gain
a Fighter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of
your choice from the {@filter Wizard spell list|spells|class=Wizard}.

When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your
choice.

### Spell Slots

The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with
this feature. To start, choose three level 1 spells from the {@filter Wizard spell
list|spells|class=Wizard}. {@spell Burning Hands|XPHB}, {@spell Jump|XPHB}, and {@spell
Shield|XPHB} are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown
in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table.
Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the {@filter Wizard spell
list|spells|class=Wizard} until the number of spells on your list matches the
number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared
spells can include five Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

### Changing your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with
another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an {@item Arcane Focus|XPHB} as a {@variantrule Spellcasting
Focus|XPHB} for your Wizard spells."""
