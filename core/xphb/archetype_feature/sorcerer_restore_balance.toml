description = """
Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic
moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll
a {@dice d20} with {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} or {@variantrule
Disadvantage|XPHB}, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to prevent the
roll from being affected by {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} and {@variantrule
Disadvantage|XPHB}.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
