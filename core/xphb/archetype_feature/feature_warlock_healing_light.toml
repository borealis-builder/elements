You gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool
of d6s to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 plus your
Warlock level.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can heal yourself or one creature you
can see within 60 feet of yourself, expending dice from the pool. The maximum
number of dice you can expend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of
one die). Roll the dice you expend, and restore a number of {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB} equal to the roll's total. Your pool regains all expended dice when
you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."""
