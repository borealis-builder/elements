As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can assume a magically majestic
presence for 1 minute or until you have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB}
condition. For the duration, whenever any creature hits you with an attack roll
for the first time on a turn, the attacker must succeed on a Charisma saving
throw against your spell save DC, or the attack misses instead, as the creature
recoils from your majesty.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."""
