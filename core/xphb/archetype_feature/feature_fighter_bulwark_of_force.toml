You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}, you can choose creatures, including yourself, within 30 feet of
yourself, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures has {@variantrule Cover|XPHB|Half
Cover} for 1 minute or until you have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB}
condition.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to
restore your use of it."""
