{@i Learn the Secrets of the Multiverse}

The counsel of a Diviner is sought by those who want a clearer understanding of
the past, present, and future. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of
space, time, and consciousness. You work to master spells of discernment, remote
viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.
