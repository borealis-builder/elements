When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB} to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don't roll those
dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For
example, instead of restoring {@dice 2d6} {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} to a
creature with a spell, you restore 12."""
