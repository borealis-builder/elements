{@i Wield Unnatural Psionic Power}

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic
power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around
you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you
be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?

Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or
you were exposed to the Far Realm's warping influence. Alternatively, you were
implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer
never occurred; now the tadpole's psionic power is yours. However you acquired
this power, your mind is aflame with it.
