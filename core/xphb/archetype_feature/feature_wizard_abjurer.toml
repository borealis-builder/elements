{@i Shield Companions and Banish Foes}

Your study of magic is focused on spells that block, banish, or protect—ending
harmful effects, banishing evil influences, and protecting the weak. Abjurers
are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when locations must be guarded
against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be
closed. Adventuring parties value Abjurers for the protection they provide
against a variety of hostile magic and other attacks.
