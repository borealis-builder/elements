You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by
your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel powers you have from this subclass. The Psi
Warrior Energy Dice table shows the die size and number of these dice you have
when you reach certain Fighter levels.

**Psi Warrior Energy Dice**

| Fighter Level | Die Size | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | {@dice D6} | 4 |
| 5 | {@dice D8} | 6 |
| 9 | {@dice D8} | 8 |
| 11 | {@dice D10} | 8 |
| 13 | {@dice D10} | 10 |
| 17 | {@dice D12} | 12 |


Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice
from this subclass. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Die, as
specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you
to use a die when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB}, and you regain all of them when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.
