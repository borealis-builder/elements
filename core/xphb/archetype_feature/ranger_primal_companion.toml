description = """
You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with
nature. Choose its stat block: {@creature Beast of the Land|XPHB}, {@creature Beast of the
Sea|XPHB}, or {@creature Beast of the Sky|XPHB}. You also determine the kind of
animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you
choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.

The beast is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It
vanishes if you die.

### The Beast in Combat

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its {@variantrule
Reaction|XPHB} on its own, but the only action it takes is the {@action
Dodge|XPHB} action unless you take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to command
it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also
sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the {@action Attack|XPHB} action to
command the beast to take the Beast's Strike action. If you have the {@condition
Incapacitated|XPHB} condition, the beast acts on its own and isn't limited to
the {@action Dodge|XPHB} action.

### Restoring or Replacing the Beast

If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB}
action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast returns to life after 1
minute with all its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} restored.

Whenever you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can summon a different
primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You
choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this
feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears."""
