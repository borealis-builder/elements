As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can expend 2 Focus Points to cause
elemental energy to burst in a 20-foot-radius {@variantrule Sphere [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Sphere} centered on a point within 120 feet of yourself. Choose a
damage type: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.

Each creature in the {@variantrule Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere} must
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage of the
chosen type equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die. On a successful save,
a creature takes half as much damage."""
