description = """
When you or an ally within 60 feet of you is about to make a {@variantrule Death Saving
Throw|XPHB}, you can unleash radiant energy to save the creature. The creature
regains {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to half its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit
Point} maximum and can end the {@condition Prone|XPHB} condition on itself. Each
creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of the creature takes Radiant
damage equal to {@dice 2d8} plus your Charisma modifier, and each has the {@condition
Blinded|XPHB} condition until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
