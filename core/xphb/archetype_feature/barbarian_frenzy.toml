If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to
the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine
the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add
them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or {@variantrule Unarmed
Strike|XPHB} used for the attack."""
