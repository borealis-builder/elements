When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the Unarmed Strikes with a
use of Hand of Healing without expending Focus Points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB} with Flurry of
Blows and deal damage, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without
expending a Focus Point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only
once per turn.

You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
