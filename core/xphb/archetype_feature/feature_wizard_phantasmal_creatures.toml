You always have the {@spell Summon Beast|XPHB} and {@spell Summon Fey|XPHB}
spells prepared. Whenever you cast either spell, you can change its school to
Illusion, which causes the summoned creature to appear spectral. You can cast
the Illusion version of each spell without expending a spell slot, but casting
it without a slot halves the creature's {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. Once you
cast either spell without a spell slot, you must finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} before you can cast the spell in that way again."""
