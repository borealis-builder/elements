description = """
You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by
your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass.
The Soulknife Energy Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you
reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.

**Soulknife Energy Dice**

| Rogue Level | Die Size | Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | {@dice D6} | 4 |
| 5 | {@dice D8} | 6 |
| 9 | {@dice D8} | 8 |
| 11 | {@dice D10} | 8 |
| 13 | {@dice D10} | 10 |
| 17 | {@dice D12} | 12 |


Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice
from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as
specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you
to use a die when your Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB}, and you regain all of them when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}.

TODO: Psi-Bolstered Knack|Rogue|XPHB|Soulknife|XPHB|3

TODO: Psychic Whispers|Rogue|XPHB|Soulknife|XPHB|3

The first time you use this power after each {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you
don't expend the Psionic Energy Die. All other times you use the power, you
expend the die."""
