You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a
spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with
that spell on the turn you cast it.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature
again before you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you take {@damage 2d12}
Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it.
This damage ignores {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} and {@variantrule
Immunity|XPHB}.

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by {@damage 1d12}."""
