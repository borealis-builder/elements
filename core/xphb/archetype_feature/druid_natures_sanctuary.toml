As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and
cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot {@variantrule Cube [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Cube} on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. They last there
for 1 minute or until you have the {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB} condition or
die. You and your allies have {@variantrule Cover|XPHB|Half Cover} while in that
area, and your allies gain the current {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} of your {@skill
Nature|XPHB}'s Ward while there.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can move the {@variantrule Cube [Area of
Effect]|XPHB|Cube} up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself."""
