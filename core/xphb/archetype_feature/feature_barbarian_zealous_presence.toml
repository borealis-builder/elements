As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you unleash a battle cry infused with
divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you
gain {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on attack rolls and saving throws until the
start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore
your use of it."""
