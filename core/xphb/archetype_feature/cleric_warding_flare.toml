description = """
When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself makes an attack
roll, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to impose {@variantrule
Disadvantage|XPHB} on the attack roll, causing light to flare before it hits or
misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
