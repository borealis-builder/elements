{@i Strike Foes with Psionic Blades}

A Soulknife strikes with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and
psychic. These Rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to
do their roguish work. As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted
you since childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the
stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and
spent years learning how to manifest your power.
