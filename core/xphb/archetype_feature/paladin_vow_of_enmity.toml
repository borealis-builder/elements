When you take the {@action Attack|XPHB} action, you can expend one use of your
Channel Divinity to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within
30 feet of yourself. You have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on attack rolls
against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

If the creature drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} before the vow ends,
you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no
action required)."""
