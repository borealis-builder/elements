As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can expend one use of your Channel
Divinity to conjure spectral vines around nearby creatures. Each creature of
your choice that you can see within 15 feet of yourself must succeed on a
Strength saving throw or have the {@condition Restrained|XPHB} condition for 1
minute. A {@condition Restrained|XPHB} creature repeats the save at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."""
