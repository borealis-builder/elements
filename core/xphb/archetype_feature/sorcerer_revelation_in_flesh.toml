description = """
You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a {@variantrule Bonus
Action|XPHB}, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point or more to magically alter your body
for 10 minutes. For each Sorcery Point you spend, you gain one of the following
benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the alteration ends.

### Aquatic Adaptation

You gain a {@variantrule Swim Speed|XPHB} equal to twice your {@variantrule
Speed|XPHB}, and you can breathe underwater. Gills grow from your neck or flare
behind your ears, and your fingers become webbed or you grow wriggling cilia.

### Glistening Flight

You gain a {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} equal to your {@variantrule
Speed|XPHB}, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or
otherworldly light.

### See the Invisible

You can see any {@condition Invisible|XPHB} creature within 60 feet of yourself
that isn't behind {@variantrule Cover|XPHB|Total Cover}. Your eyes also turn
black or become writhing sensory tendrils.

### Wormlike Movement

Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy
and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch, and you can
spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or the {@condition
Grappled|XPHB} condition."""
