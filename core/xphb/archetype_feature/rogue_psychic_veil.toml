You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As a {@action
Magic|XPHB} action, you gain the {@condition Invisible|XPHB} condition for 1
hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility
ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a
creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to
restore your use of it."""
