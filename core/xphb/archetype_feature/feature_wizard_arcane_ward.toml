description = """
You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an Abjuration
spell with a spell slot, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's
magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}. The ward has a {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} maximum
equal to twice your Wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you
take damage, the ward takes the damage instead, and if you have any Resistances
or Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward's {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB}. If the damage reduces the ward to 0 {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB}, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 {@variantrule Hit
Points|XPHB}, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains.

Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell with a spell slot, the ward regains a
number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to twice the level of the spell
slot. Alternatively, as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can expend a
spell slot, and the ward regains a number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}
equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.

Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB}."""
