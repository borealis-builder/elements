{@i Bargain with Whimsical Fey}

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you
might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air
and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an
ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and
debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.
