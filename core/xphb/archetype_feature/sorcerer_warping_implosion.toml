description = """
You can unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you
teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself.
Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you
left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed
save, a creature takes {@damage 3d10} Force damage and is pulled straight toward
the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space
as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a {@variantrule Long
Rest|XPHB} unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore
your use of it."""
