description = """
When you cast {@spell Summon Aberration|XPHB}, you can modify it so that it
doesn't require {@status Concentration|XPHB}. If you do so, the spell's duration
becomes 1 minute for that casting, and when summoned, the Aberration has a
number of {@variantrule Temporary Hit Points|XPHB} equal to your Warlock level
plus your Charisma modifier.

In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the
effect of your {@spell Hex|XPHB}, the Aberration deals extra Psychic damage to
the target equal to the bonus damage of that spell."""
