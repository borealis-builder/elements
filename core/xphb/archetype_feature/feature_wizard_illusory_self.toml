When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a {@variantrule
Reaction|XPHB} to interpose an illusory duplicate of yourself between the
attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion
dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a {@variantrule Short
Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. You can also restore your use
of it by expending a level 2+ spell slot (no action required)."""
